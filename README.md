This repository contains scripts used to validate proposals. The scripts are written in Go and utilize various packages
to interact with the Internet Computer (IC) governance and registry systems.

- `133083_test.go`: Contains tests for validating proposal 133083.
- `go.mod`: Go module file for managing dependencies.

## Running the Tests
